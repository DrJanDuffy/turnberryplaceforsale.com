# Dr. Jan Duffy - Las Vegas Real Estate Development Rules

## Project Context
- Developer: Dr. Jan Duffy, Las Vegas Real Estate Expert
- License: S.0197614.LLC | Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties
- Primary Stack: Next.js 14+, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, GitHub
- Domain Portfolio: 135+ hyperlocal Las Vegas real estate domains

## Iteration Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before presenting ANY code:
1. Draft 1: Write initial solution
2. Draft 2: Optimize for performance & SEO
3. Draft 3: Error check, edge cases, mobile responsiveness
4. Draft 4: Verify all imports, dependencies, API calls
5. Final Review: Production-ready check

Never show intermediate drafts - only present refined, deployable code.

---

## Tech Stack Rules

### Next.js / React
- Use App Router (not Pages Router) unless specified
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Always include: metadata, OpenGraph tags, JSON-LD schema
- Image optimization: next/image with proper alt tags for SEO
- File naming: kebab-case for routes, PascalCase for components

### Cloudflare Workers
- Keep workers lightweight (<1MB)
- Use appropriate bindings: KV, D1, R2 as needed
- Include error handling with meaningful responses
- Test locally with wrangler before suggesting deployment
- RealScout widget injection: validate domain matching

### SEO (Critical for Real Estate)
- Every page MUST include:
  - Unique title tag with neighborhood + "Las Vegas Real Estate"
  - Meta description (150-160 chars) with CTA
  - JSON-LD LocalBusiness + RealEstateAgent schema
  - Canonical URL
  - Open Graph image (1200x630)
- Internal linking to neighborhood pages
- "Near me" keyword optimization
- Mobile-first (Google's primary index)

### RealScout Integration
- Widget loads asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Fallback content if widget fails
- UTM parameters preserved through widget
- Lead capture validation before submission

---

## Code Style

### Formatting
- 2 space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in arrays/objects
- Descriptive variable names (not generic like "data" or "item")

### Comments
- Header comment block with file purpose
- Inline comments for complex logic only
- TODO format: // TODO: [description] - Dr. Jan [date]

### Error Handling
- Try/catch on all async operations
- User-friendly error messages (not technical jargon)
- Console.error for debugging, never in production
- Fallback UI states for failed API calls
